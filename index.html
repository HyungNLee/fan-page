    <p>Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California.
       It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and
        rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden,
         lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist
          PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. Original members
           Levine, Carmichael, Madden and drummer Ryan Dusick first came
            together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in
             high school. After self-releasing their independent album
              We Like Digging? in 1995, the band signed to Reprise Records
               and released the only debut album The Fourth World in 1997.
                The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record
                 label dropped the band and the members focused on college.
